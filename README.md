Overview: 
I did these data visualizations with a data set found on Kaggle. It's a binary data set with features including the transaction ID and items sold at coffee shop called Market Basket.
I created this Python notebook to show how popular each item is relative to one another and to determine the popularity of food versus drinks at this shop. 

**Dataset:**
This is a comma separated file containing transactional data. The structure consists of the following: the first column contains the transaction ID and the remaining columns are the items available at the coffee show. Each cell contains a binary value (1 for sold and 0 for not sold) 

**Skills and Tools Used:**
This was coded in python with the packages matplotlib (visualization) and pandas (data manipulation and analysis) being used entirely. 

**Key Insights:**
The only key insights able to derived from this data were which items were most popular and whether food or drinks were more popular.
