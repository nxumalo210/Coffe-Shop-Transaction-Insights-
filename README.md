Overview: 
These are some data visualizations that I did with a data set found on Kaggle. It's a data set of binary data with the features including the transaction ID and items sold at the coffee shop. 
I created this dataset to show how popular each item is relative to one another. 

Tools Used: 
I used Python and mainly focused on the following packages:
  matplotlib
  pandas
  numpy
