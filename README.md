Overview: 
These are some data visualizations that I did with a data set found on Kaggle. It's a data set of binary data with the features including the transaction ID and items sold at the coffee shop. 
I created this dataset to show how popular each item is relative to one another. 

Tools Used: 
This was coded in python with the packages matplotlib, pandas, and numpy being the main focus.
